## About
===

I wanted to create an application to help my fellow classmates find their future jobs after bootcamp. With this inspiration, I wanted to learn how to make a mobile application so I learned how to build a React-Native app in 2 days. On The Hunt was also built using Firebase (non-relational database). By using Firebase-realtime database I was able to include authentication and update the data in real time. A user had the option of adding jobs to their saved or applied list. A user can also view job descriptions.
